Responsive-HTML5-template
=========================

Extremely simple and light, easily customizable HTML5 template for responsive designs.

It includes index.html that has all HTML5 tags in place and link to default stylesheet. The stylesheet does
not have any actual CSS rules, but empty sections for body and @media tags to start creating responsive designs
more quickly. There are also empty directories for putting JavaScript files and images.

The template also includes favicon.

The general fundamental is that more features/plugins/frameworks can be added easily, but nothing should be deleted
from the template to make it suitable for your needs. That being said, if you have no need for responsive design
(@media -rules), then this template is not for your needs. Nothing prevents you from using this template and
removing the responsiveness though.

This template does not come with normalized CSS, JQuery, HTML5shiv or Google Analytics -magic. If you need them,
include them by hand.
